INSTALLATION:
=============

Full installation:
------------------
  This package installs:
  * TeX files in $(texmf_prefix) 
    a standard TDS is assumed here: see http://www.tug.org/twg/tds/
    (with scripts in $(texmf_prefix)/scripts/latex-make)
  * a symbolic link for the Makefile snipset in $(prefix)/include
    (to $(texmf_prefix)/scripts/latex-make)
  
  Default values are:
  prefix=/usr/local
  texmf_prefix=$(prefix)/share/texmf
  
  You can make a default install with:
  make install
  
  To install latex-make conforming to the FHS, you can type:
  make install prefix=/usr
  
  To install in HOME directory, you can use:
  make install prefix=$HOME texmf_prefix=$HOME/texmf
  In this case, to not forget to invoke make(1) with the '-I' option:
  make -I${HOME}/include ...
  
  If you want to install the files needed in a directory containing a LaTeX
  document (so that compiling in this directory does not need the installation
  of this package), please refers to the README file.

  Note:
  *****
  Do not forget to run "texhash" once you have installed/removed files in a
  TeX Directory Structure 

Building main files:
--------------------
  If you just want to get main files (Makefile snipset, scripts and LaTeX
  style), go to the src/ directory and type 'make' (or 'make doc' if you
  also want the documentation)

  The example/ directory contains a very small example of what can be done with
  this software. [to be improved, patches welcome]


REQUIREMENTS:
=============

General:
--------

  In order to work, LaTeX Make requires:
  - GNU Make (>= 3.81)
    type "make --version" to check
  - a relatively recent LaTeX distribution (teTeX 3.0 should work,
    TeXLive >= 2005 also)
  
  If using figlatex, LaTeX Make also needs:
  - inkscape (>= 0.48.2) for converting svg files
  - transfig (>= 3.2.4) for the fig2dev command
    type "transfig -V" to check
  - ghostscript that is called by fig2dev
    type "gs --version" to check
  
Notes for MacOS X users:
------------------------
[I'm not sure these notes are up-to-date. Patches welcome]

  make 3.81
  *********
  make 3.81 is included at least with XCode 4 and 10.6 Snow Leopard. Otherwise,
  you need to install it with MacPorts, Fink or to manually recompile it. The
  latter is easy:
  1) get the sources (tar.gz) and unpack them
  2) go to the new directory and type:
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
       make
       sudo make install
  3) add /usr/local/bin in your PATH
  
  Note that you can choose another prefix if you like (for example
  /usr/local/make-3.81). Setup your PATH accordingly in this case.
  
  inkscape 0.48.2
  ***************
  Inkscape can be downloaded from the official site (http://inkscape.org/).
  However, the binary must be in the path. An easy way is to create a file
  /usr/bin/inkscape (don't forget to chmod a+x this file) with: 
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/bin/inkscape $*



  teTeX
  *****
  teTeX can be installed with the Darwin port[1].
  Note: the installer requires that /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local
  is a valid TeX Directory Structure[2]. This is the case with the
  Darwin port.

  A very simple way to install a complete LaTeX distribution is to 
  install MacTex (http://www.tug.org/mactex/). LaTeX addons are located in
  ~/Library/texmf.
  
  transfig
  ********
  The transfig package in the stable fink[3] distribution is compiled
  with an deprecated option. In consequence, fig2dev uses \epsfig
  instead of \includegraphics in its generated files.
  One of the three workaround can be used:
  1) add \let\epsfig=\includegraphics at the begining of your document
     (just after the \begin{document})
     Of course, this will not work if you were using the deprecated
     epsfig package.
  2) use the transfig-graphicx package from the unstable fink[3]
     distribution
  3) recompile the transfig package without "DDEPSFIG = -DEPSFIG"
     (look in the applied patch and remove the removal of XCOMM for the
     line "XCOMM DDEPSFIG = -DEPSFIG" for the file fig2dev/Imakefile)
  
  ghostscript
  ***********
  The ghostscript package can be found in the stable fink[3]
  distribution.
